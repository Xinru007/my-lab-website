The Wang's Lab at SUNY Upstate Medical University is engaged in research on tick biology and its interaction with intracellular bacterial pathogens that they transmit. We are building a unique resource by discovering protein-protein interactions between ticks and bacteria, which play a critical role in determining pathogen invasion, propagation, and transmission.
